## Why RoselineMCP

Your coding agent shouldn't read a 700-line file to change one method. Source code dominates an
agent's token budget, so the cheapest win is to stop feeding it whole files.

RoselineMCP wraps the [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) compiler platform as an MCP server.
Instead of dumping source into the model, it answers *structural* questions precisely — where is
this symbol used, what implements this interface, who calls this method, what's the shape of this
file — and it edits **surgically**: a member-level diff, not a whole-file rewrite.

On RoselineMCP's own source, the read-only navigation tools returned a **median 85% fewer tokens
per task** (pooled, size-weighted: 93%) than reading the corresponding files —
[measured honestly, weak cases included](https://atypical-consulting.github.io/RoselineMCP/benchmark).

> `search_symbols` on `Program.cs`: **2,093 tokens → 120** (−94%). The agent gets the shape of the
> file; you skip the wall.

## Quick Start

Any MCP client that speaks `dnx` (the .NET equivalent of `npx`) runs it on demand — no install step.
Requires the .NET 10 SDK.

```jsonc
// claude_desktop_config.json  ·  .vscode/mcp.json  ·  ~/.cursor/mcp.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "roseline": { "command": "dnx", "args": ["RoselineMCP", "--yes"] }
  }
}
```

Then ask your agent to *"find every caller of `OrderService.Checkout`"* or *"rename `Foo` to `Bar`
across the solution."* Prefer a pinned NuGet install or Docker? See
[Getting Started](#getting-started).

## Features

- [x] **Token-efficient code navigation** -- symbols, references, call graphs, type hierarchies, and file outlines via Roslyn instead of whole files. A measured **85% median** token reduction per task (93% pooled, size-weighted) -- [see the benchmark](https://atypical-consulting.github.io/RoselineMCP/benchmark).
- [x] **Surgical code edits** -- replace/add/delete a member or rename a symbol solution-wide, emitting a unified diff instead of a whole-file rewrite. Preview by default.
- [x] **Comprehensive analysis & auto-fix** -- diagnostics across a solution (Roslyn + Roslynator) with automated fixes and reviewable patches.
- [x] **Read-only by default** -- the seven navigation tools and the diagnostics/patch tools never touch disk; the three write tools require an explicit `previewOnly: false`.
- [x] **Compile guard (opt-in)** -- a `PostToolUse` hook that puts the compiler's verdict behind **every** file write, not just RoselineMCP's own -- see [Compile guard](#compile-guard) below.
- [x] **Works with your client** -- Claude Desktop, VS Code (Copilot / MCP), Cursor. Install via `dnx`, NuGet global tool, or Docker.
- [x] **Honest, reproducible benchmark** -- run it against your own solution: `dotnet run --project RoselineMCP.TokenBenchmark -c Release`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **NuGet global tool**: .NET 10.0 SDK or later
- **Docker**: Docker Desktop or Docker Engine
- **Build from source**: .NET 10.0 SDK + MSBuild (included with Visual Studio or .NET SDK)
- **MCP client**: Claude Desktop or any MCP-compatible client

### Installation

> **Claude Desktop, one click:** download **`RoselineMCP.mcpb`** from the
> [latest release](https://github.com/Atypical-Consulting/RoselineMCP/releases/latest) and open it —
> Claude Desktop shows an install dialog, no config editing. (It launches via `dnx` under the hood,
> so the .NET 10 SDK is still required.) Prefer to edit config yourself, or using another client?
> Use one of the options below.

**Option 1 -- `dnx` (no install step)** *(recommended)*

RoselineMCP ships an [MCP server registry manifest](.mcp/server.json), so any MCP client that
understands the `dnx` launcher (the .NET equivalent of `npx` — resolves and runs a NuGet-packaged
tool on demand, without a separate `dotnet tool install` step) can start it directly. Requires the
.NET 10.0 SDK.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "roseline": {
      "command": "dnx",
      "args": ["RoselineMCP", "--yes"]
    }
  }
}
```

Add this to your Claude Desktop or VS Code MCP configuration (see
[MCP Client Compatibility](#mcp-client-compatibility) below for exact file locations per client).
`dnx` downloads and caches the tool on first use, so there's nothing to pre-install globally.

---

**Option 2 -- NuGet Global Tool** *(offline / pinned-version installs)*

Requires .NET 10.0 SDK or later.

```bash
dotnet tool install -g RoselineMCP
```

After installation, the `roseline-mcp` command is available globally.

#### Claude Desktop configuration (NuGet global tool)

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration file (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "roseline": {
      "command": "roseline-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

> **Config file location:**
> - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
> - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

---

**Option 3 -- Docker**

No SDK required. Works on any platform with Docker installed.

```bash
docker run -i --rm phmatray/roseline-mcp:latest
```

#### Claude Desktop configuration (Docker)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "roseline": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "phmatray/roseline-mcp:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** The `-i` flag is required for stdio transport. The `--rm` flag removes the container after the session ends.

---

**Option 4 -- Build from Source**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Atypical-Consulting/RoselineMCP.git
cd RoselineMCP
dotnet build
dotnet test
```

#### Claude Desktop configuration (build from source)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "roseline": {
      "command": "dotnet",
      "args": ["run", "--project", "/path/to/RoselineMCP/RoselineMCP.csproj"]
    }
  }
}
```

## MCP Client Compatibility

RoselineMCP speaks plain stdio MCP, so it should work with any MCP-compatible client. The
snippets below are **documented, not independently verified in every case** — we've confirmed the
protocol-level behavior (stdio transport, tool discovery, JSON responses) works correctly, but we
have not personally exercised each client's own configuration UI/file end to end. If one of these
doesn't work as written for your client version, please open an issue.

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Desktop</strong></summary>

Edit `claude_desktop_config.json` (see file locations under [Installation](#getting-started)
above) and add a `roseline` entry under `mcpServers`, using any of the four install options shown
above (`dnx`, global tool, Docker, or build-from-source).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>VS Code (GitHub Copilot / MCP extension)</strong></summary>

Add an entry to your workspace or user `mcp.json` (Command Palette → "MCP: Open User
Configuration", or `.vscode/mcp.json` in the workspace):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "roseline": {
      "command": "dnx",
      "args": ["RoselineMCP", "--yes"]
    }
  }
}
```

Substitute `"command": "roseline-mcp"` (no `args`) if you installed via the NuGet global tool
instead.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Cursor</strong></summary>

Add a `roseline` entry to `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (global) or `.cursor/mcp.json` (project-local),
using the same `command`/`args` shape as the VS Code snippet above.

</details>

## Available Tools

Every tool's description — the text an MCP client shows the model at tool-selection time — states
its own `Limitations:` and shows one `Example:` call, within a test-enforced word ceiling; the
twelve tools with an optional `project` share one wording for the worktree caveat below, and
`resolvedPath` is how you confirm which checkout actually answered. See
[docs/API.md § Tool description contract](docs/API.md#tool-description-contract).

### 1. AnalyzeSolution

Analyzes an entire C# solution for diagnostics. Read-only — never modifies files on disk.
`pathOrGit` also accepts an `http(s)://` Git URL, which is shallow-cloned to a temp directory,
analyzed, and deleted afterward.

```typescript
analyzeSolution({
  pathOrGit: "/path/to/solution.sln",
  include: "Core",              // Optional: only project names containing this substring
  exclude: "Test",              // Optional: skip project names containing this substring
  severity: "warning",          // Optional: minimum severity (Error|Warning|Info|Hidden)
  maxDiagnostics: 100           // Optional: Maximum diagnostics to return (default: 100)
})
```

**Returns:** solution file name, project count, a `diagnosticSummary` (counts by severity), a
`topDiagnostics` array with project/file/line/column/id/severity/message per diagnostic, and
`analyzerLoad` — present only when an analyzer reference contributed nothing (merged across the
analyzed projects), naming it and why.

### 2. ListDiagnostics

Gets detailed diagnostics for a specific project. Read-only — never modifies files on disk.
`project` is **optional** and accepts the same references as the navigation tools (name,
directory, `.csproj`, or `.sln` path); when omitted, the solution/project is auto-discovered from
the working directory.

```typescript
listDiagnostics({
  project: "MyProject.csproj",     // Optional: name, directory, .csproj, or .sln; auto-discovered if omitted
  ids: ["CS0168", "CS0219"],       // Optional: Filter by diagnostic IDs
  files: ["Controller.cs"],        // Optional: substring match against each diagnostic's file path (case-insensitive; NOT a glob pattern)
  max: 50                          // Optional: Maximum results
})
```

**Returns:** project name, `resolvedPath` (the absolute `.sln`/`.csproj` actually loaded),
`totalDiagnostics` count, the filtered `diagnostics` list, `stats` (counts grouped by ID and by
severity), `suggestedFixableIds` — diagnostic IDs a code fix provider is actually registered for,
whether it ships with Roslyn, in the bundled Roslynator catalog, or **inside one of the project's
own analyzer references** — and `analyzerLoad`, which names every analyzer reference that
contributed nothing (and why), present only when there is something to say.

### 3. ApplyFixes

Applies automated code fixes for specified diagnostics. **Defaults to preview mode**:
`previewOnly` defaults to `true`, so calling this tool without setting it never writes to disk —
you must pass `previewOnly: false` explicitly to apply changes. `project` is **optional** and
accepts the same references as the navigation tools (name, directory, `.csproj`, or `.sln` path);
when omitted, the solution/project is auto-discovered from the working directory. For a **write**
(`previewOnly: false`) make it an **absolute** path — see the worktree note below.

```typescript
applyFixes({
  ids: ["CS0168", "RCS1001"],   // Diagnostic IDs to fix
  project: "/repo/src/MyProject/MyProject.csproj",  // Optional; absolute for a write (see the worktree note)
  previewOnly: false             // Optional (default: true). Set false to write changes to disk.
})
```

**Returns:** project name, `resolvedPath` (the absolute `.sln`/`.csproj` actually loaded),
`fixedCount`, `fixersApplied` (diagnostic IDs actually fixed), `changedFiles`
(relative to `resolvedPath`'s directory, forward slashes — the same path base as the navigation
tools), a unified
diff `patch`, `notes` (the scope — which project was fixed and which of the solution's projects were
not analyzed, plus any linked file whose write reaches a sibling — and skipped/failed IDs and status
messages), `previewOnly` echoing back what the caller asked for, `applied` (whether anything
actually reached disk), `verification` — the compiler's verdict on the fixed code — and
`analyzerLoad` (present only when an analyzer reference contributed nothing, so "no diagnostics
found for X" can be told apart from "the analyzer that reports X never loaded"). Fixers are looked
up in the Roslyn built-ins, then the bundled Roslynator catalog, then the project's own analyzer
references; the bundled provider wins for an ID both carry.

A `.sln` target fixes **one** project — its primary project — and that scope is enforced on the
write path, not only announced by the confirmation prompt: only the anchor project's documents are
verified and written, and a caller who never sees a prompt (preview, a non-eliciting client, an
unattended host) still reads which projects were skipped in `notes`. Pass a `.csproj` to fix a
specific project — then nothing is reported as skipped, since that is what was asked for.

### 14. CheckCompilation

Answers **"does this compile right now, and what broke"** against on-disk state — the replacement
for a `dotnet build` round trip in an agent's edit loop. Read-only, and compiler diagnostics only:
analyzers cost several times a bare compile, which is the whole reason this tool is fast enough to
run after every edit.

It reports on whatever is on disk, whoever wrote it, so it works just as well for edits made by
other tools. The speed comes from the warm `MSBuildWorkspace` the server already holds: the first
call of a session pays a cold load, every call after it reuses an incremental Roslyn compilation.

```typescript
checkCompilation({
  project: "MyApp.sln",  // Optional: name, directory, .csproj, or .sln; auto-discovered if omitted
  max: 20                 // Optional (default: 20). The rest are counted in `omitted`.
})
```

**Returns:** `resolvedPath`, `compiles`, `errors` (omitted when it compiles), `omitted`, `scope`
(the projects compiled), `scopeComplete` and `notes`.

> **`check_compilation` vs `list_diagnostics`:** `check_compilation` answers *"is it still
> building?"* — compiler errors, fast, for the edit loop. `list_diagnostics` answers *"what should I
> clean up?"* — analyzer diagnostics, statistics, and which IDs are auto-fixable. Reach for the
> first after an edit and the second when exploring.

### 4. CreatePatch

Generates a unified diff between two text versions. Read-only — operates purely on the provided
strings, never touches the filesystem.

```typescript
createPatch({
  before: "original code",
  after: "modified code",
  fileName: "Example.cs",        // Optional: For display in diff
  ignoreWhitespace: false,       // Optional: ignore whitespace-only differences
  ignoreCase: false              // Optional: ignore case differences
})
```

**Returns:** the unified diff `patch`, `hasChanges`, `linesAdded`, `linesRemoved`, and the
`fileName`/`summary` used in the diff header.

### Code Navigation Tools (read-only)

These tools return **precise structure instead of whole files**, so an AI agent can orient itself
in a codebase while spending far fewer tokens than reading source directly. All are read-only and
take an **optional** `project` (name, directory, `.csproj` path, or `.sln` path) — when omitted,
RoselineMCP auto-discovers the solution/project from its working directory. When the project belongs
to a solution, the whole solution is loaded and symbol search/resolution spans every project in it
(including sibling projects the requested project doesn't reference), so references/renames span
projects. Full request/response shapes are in [docs/API.md](docs/API.md).

> **Working in a git worktree?** Auto-discovery is anchored to **the server's** working directory —
> the one the MCP client launched RoselineMCP in, fixed for the life of the process — not yours. What
> matters is only that the two differ, whether you walked into another checkout or were started in
> one: a worktree (e.g. `.claude/worktrees/<name>`) sits below the discovery walk's reach, so an
> omitted `project` resolves the **main checkout** instead. Every tool that takes an optional
> `project` — the seven navigation tools, both edit tools, `listDiagnostics` and `applyFixes` —
> reports `resolvedPath`, the absolute `.sln`/`.csproj` that actually answered — the `.sln` when the
> solution was loaded and contains the project, otherwise the `.csproj` that was opened directly
> (e.g. a project not listed in its nearest ancestor `.sln`). Check it, and pass
> an absolute path as `project` to target a specific checkout. (`analyzeSolution` is the exception:
> its `pathOrGit` is required, so it auto-discovers nothing.)
>
> **How you meet this depends on whether you are reading or writing.** A **read** for something the
> other checkout does not have answers `NotFoundError: Symbol not found: 'X'`; a read for something
> it does answers successfully, with a `resolvedPath` you did not expect. Either way the failure
> envelope's `error.resolvedPath` names the checkout that was searched (omitted entirely when the
> call failed before resolving anything), so "not there" stays distinguishable from "wrong tree".
>
> A **write** is not left to that: two checkouts of one repository mostly hold the *same* code, so a
> wrong-checkout write resolves, applies and returns an ordinary success in the tree you did not
> mean — disclosure that arrives only in the response to the call that already changed the file. So
> `applyFixes`, `editMember` and `renameSymbol` called with `previewOnly: false` and a `project`
> that is **not an absolute path** — omitted, blank, `"."`, a bare project name, a relative
> `"App.sln"` — are refused outright (`ValidationError`, nothing written, no prompt) when the
> resolved checkout belongs to a repository with linked worktrees — regardless of
> `RoselineMCP:ConfirmDestructiveWrites`. Only an **absolute** `project` steps past the refusal,
> because only an absolute path names a checkout: every other spelling resolves against the server's
> working directory, the very thing you don't know. See
> [docs/API.md](docs/API.md#which-checkout-answered).
>
> **Relative file paths hang off `resolvedPath`.** The navigation tools' `file`/`definitionFile`,
> `applyFixes`/`editMember`/`renameSymbol`'s `changedFiles` **and patch headers**, and
> `verification.errors[]`/`checkCompilation`'s `errors[]` `file`, are relative
> to the directory containing `resolvedPath` — so `dirname(resolvedPath) + <returned path>` is the
> real file, and a returned `patch` applies (`git apply -p1`) from that directory. That is the
> solution root in the usual case, and the project's own directory whenever a `.csproj` answered
> directly — including a project not listed in its nearest ancestor `.sln`. One exception:
> `listDiagnostics`/`analyzeSolution` report `file` **absolute**, so there is nothing to join. See
> [docs/API.md](docs/API.md#code-navigation-tools).

> **Tool names on the wire are `snake_case`.** The section headings below use friendly
> PascalCase/`camelCase` for readability, but the actual MCP tool names returned by `tools/list`
> (and expected by `tools/call`) are: `search_symbols`, `get_symbol_info`, `find_references`,
> `find_implementations`, `get_call_graph`, `get_type_hierarchy`, `get_symbol_at_position`,
> `edit_member`, `rename_symbol`
> (matching the existing `analyze_solution` / `list_diagnostics` / `apply_fixes` /
> `check_compilation` / `create_patch`).

#### 5. SearchSymbols

Find symbols by wildcard/substring name pattern, or outline a single file.

```typescript
searchSymbols({
  project: "MyApp.Core",
  query: "*Service",             // Substring, or wildcard with * and ? — omit to outline a file
  file: "UserService.cs",        // Optional: restrict to one file, or outline it when query omitted
  kinds: ["class", "method"],    // Optional: filter by kind (also accepts "type" / "member")
  max: 50                        // Optional (default: 50)
})
```

**Returns:** `symbols` (name, fullName, kind, signature, file, line — `file` is relative to `resolvedPath`'s directory; the single-file outline instead returns name, kind, signature, line, containingType), `totalFound`, `truncated` (omitted when not capped).

#### 6. GetSymbolInfo

The compact "go to definition": a symbol's declaration metadata and (optionally) its source.

```typescript
getSymbolInfo({
  project: "MyApp.Core",
  symbol: "Acme.Users.UserService.GetUser",  // Simple or fully-qualified name
  includeSource: true                          // Optional (default: true)
})
```

**Returns:** name, fullName, kind, signature, and (each omitted when empty/absent) modifiers, baseTypes, interfaces, documentation, definitionFile/Line, and source. Accessibility is already part of `signature`; `definitionFile` is relative to `resolvedPath`'s directory.

#### 7. FindReferences

Every use site of a symbol across the solution, as location + one-line snippet.

```typescript
findReferences({ project: "MyApp.Core", symbol: "GetUser", includeDefinition: false, max: 100 })
```

**Returns:** `references` (file — relative to `resolvedPath`'s directory, line, snippet), `totalReferences`, `truncated` (omitted when not capped).

#### 8. FindImplementations

Implementations of an interface/member, overrides of a virtual/abstract member, or derived types of a class.

```typescript
findImplementations({ project: "MyApp.Core", symbol: "IRepository", max: 100 })
```

**Returns:** `implementations` (symbol summaries), `totalFound`, `truncated`.

#### 9. GetCallGraph

A depth-bounded caller and/or callee graph for a method, with cycle detection.

```typescript
getCallGraph({
  project: "MyApp.Core",
  method: "Handle",
  direction: "callers",   // "callers" (default) | "callees" | "both"
  depth: 1,               // 1-3 (default: 1)
  max: 50                 // Optional: nodes expanded per direction
})
```

**Returns:** `callers`/`callees` trees of nodes (fullName with simple parameter-type names, file — relative to `resolvedPath`'s directory, line, truncated, children). Call GetSymbolInfo for a node's full signature.

#### 10. GetTypeHierarchy

A type's base-class chain, implemented interfaces, and/or derived types.

```typescript
getTypeHierarchy({
  project: "MyApp.Core",
  type: "SqlRepository",
  direction: "both",   // "base" | "derived" | "both" (default)
  max: 100             // Optional: maximum derived types returned (default: 100)
})
```

**Returns:** `baseTypes`, `interfaces`, `derivedTypes` (as symbol summaries).

#### 13. GetSymbolAtPosition

The symbol living at a `file:line(:column)` position — turn a diagnostic, stack trace, or grep hit
into a symbol name without reading the file.

```typescript
getSymbolAtPosition({
  project: "MyApp.Core",
  file: "UserService.cs",  // File name or path suffix (same matching as SearchSymbols)
  line: 42,                // 1-based
  column: 17               // Optional (1-based) — omit to resolve the most relevant symbol on the line
})
```

**Returns:** name, fullName, kind, signature, `isDeclaration` (whether the position sits on the symbol's own declaration), and (each omitted when empty/absent) containingType, documentation, definitionFile/Line (relative to `resolvedPath`'s directory). Line-only queries prefer declarations on the line over referenced symbols.

### Code Editing Tools (preview by default)

Surgical edits that emit a member-level change rather than a whole-file rewrite. Like `ApplyFixes`,
both **default to preview mode** (`previewOnly: true`) — nothing is written to disk unless you pass
`previewOnly: false` explicitly.

#### 11. EditMember

Replace, add, or delete a single type member; returns a unified diff.

```typescript
editMember({
  project: "/repo/src/MyApp.Core/MyApp.Core.csproj",
  symbol: "Acme.UserService.GetUser",  // The member (replace/delete), or the container type (add)
  operation: "replace",                 // "replace" | "add" | "delete"
  newSource: "public User GetUser(int id) => _repo.Find(id);",  // Required for replace/add
  previewOnly: false                    // Optional (default: true). Set false to write to disk.
})
```

**Returns:** operation, target, `changedFiles`, `patch`, `previewOnly`, `applied`, `notes`.

#### 12. RenameSymbol

Rename a symbol and update every reference across the solution (Roslyn rename); returns a unified diff.

```typescript
renameSymbol({ project: "/repo/src/MyApp.Core/MyApp.Core.csproj", symbol: "GetUser", newName: "GetUserById", previewOnly: false })
```

**Returns:** symbol, newName, `changedFiles`, `patch`, `previewOnly`, `applied`, `verification`, `notes`.

> **Every write is compile-verified.** Before `edit_member`, `rename_symbol` or `apply_fixes`
> touches disk, the candidate change is compiled in memory. If it *introduces* compiler errors —
> including in a downstream project you never named — the write is **refused**: the call still
> succeeds, `applied` comes back `false`, nothing is written, and you get the diff *and* the
> errors. Pass `allowIntroducedErrors: true` to write anyway. A repository that was already
> broken stays editable: the gate is what the change *introduces*, never whether the tree
> compiles. See [Compile Verification](docs/API.md#compile-verification) for the scope rule and
> the guarantee boundary.

## Tool Annotations

RoselineMCP's SDK (`ModelContextProtocol` 2.2.0) supports the standard MCP tool
[annotation hints](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`,
`idempotentHint`), and every tool declares them via `[McpServerTool(ReadOnly = ..., Destructive =
..., Idempotent = ...)]`:

| Tool | readOnlyHint | destructiveHint | idempotentHint | Notes |
|------|:---:|:---:|:---:|-------|
| `AnalyzeSolution` | ✅ true | ❌ false | ✅ true | Never writes to disk. |
| `ListDiagnostics` | ✅ true | ❌ false | ✅ true | Never writes to disk. |
| `ApplyFixes` | ❌ false | ⚠️ true | ❌ false | `destructiveHint` is a static, worst-case annotation: it's `true` because the tool *can* write files when `previewOnly: false` is passed, even though the default call (`previewOnly` unset, i.e. `true`) writes nothing. The SDK's annotation model has no way to express "destructive only for a specific parameter value" — see the doc comment on `ApplyFixesTool.ApplyFixes` in source. |
| `CheckCompilation` | ✅ true | ❌ false | ✅ true | Never writes to disk. Compiles the loaded solution and reports the compiler's verdict. |
| `CreatePatch` | ✅ true | ❌ false | ✅ true | Operates purely on the two provided strings; never touches the filesystem. |
| `SearchSymbols` | ✅ true | ❌ false | ✅ true | Never writes to disk. |
| `GetSymbolInfo` | ✅ true | ❌ false | ✅ true | Never writes to disk. |
| `FindReferences` | ✅ true | ❌ false | ✅ true | Never writes to disk. |
| `FindImplementations` | ✅ true | ❌ false | ✅ true | Never writes to disk. |
| `GetCallGraph` | ✅ true | ❌ false | ✅ true | Never writes to disk. |
| `GetTypeHierarchy` | ✅ true | ❌ false | ✅ true | Never writes to disk. |
| `GetSymbolAtPosition` | ✅ true | ❌ false | ✅ true | Never writes to disk. |
| `EditMember` | ❌ false | ⚠️ true | ❌ false | Same worst-case `destructiveHint` rationale as `ApplyFixes`: writes a file only when `previewOnly: false` is passed; the default call writes nothing. |
| `RenameSymbol` | ❌ false | ⚠️ true | ❌ false | Same worst-case `destructiveHint` rationale as `ApplyFixes`: writes files only when `previewOnly: false` is passed; the default call writes nothing. |

These hints are static per-tool metadata for MCP clients that surface them (e.g. to warn a user
before an agent invokes a destructive tool) — they describe the tool's worst-case behavior, not
the outcome of any specific call. See [Tool Compatibility Policy](#tool-compatibility-policy)
below for the stability guarantees around tool names and parameters that these annotations sit on
top of.

## Tool Compatibility Policy

- **Tool names and required parameters are stable within a major version.** An MCP client
  integration written against `AnalyzeSolution(pathOrGit, ...)` on `1.x` will keep working across
  all `1.x` releases.
- **Optional parameters may be added in minor versions** (e.g. `CreatePatch` gained
  `ignoreWhitespace`/`ignoreCase` as optional, defaulted parameters without breaking existing
  callers).
- **Renaming or removing a parameter, changing a parameter's required/optional status, or
  changing a tool's name is a breaking change.** Breaking changes are called out under a
  dedicated "Breaking Changes" heading in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) and only ship in a major
  version bump.
- Response *shapes* (JSON field names/types) are documented in [`docs/API.md`](docs/API.md) and
  follow the same policy: additive fields are non-breaking, renamed/removed fields are breaking.

## Supported Analyzers

The diagnostics tools (`analyze_solution`, `list_diagnostics`, `apply_fixes`) report compiler
diagnostics plus analyzer diagnostics, executed via Roslyn's `CompilationWithAnalyzers`
(`check_compilation` is deliberately **not** in this list — it is compiler-only, which is what makes
it fast enough for an edit loop):

- **Roslyn Analyzers** -- Built-in C# compiler diagnostics
- **Roslynator** -- 500+ analyzers and fixes for C#, **bundled with RoselineMCP** (shipped as an
  `analyzers/` folder next to `RoselineMCP.dll`) and executed by default, so RCS* diagnostics
  surface and are fixable out of the box
- **Custom Analyzers** -- Any Roslyn-based analyzer referenced by your analyzed solution is
  loaded from the project's analyzer references and run alongside the bundled ones (there is no
  built-in StyleCop.Analyzers reference — add it to your analyzed solution if you want SA*
  diagnostics). **Their code fixers are loaded too**: an analyzer-reported rule is auto-fixable
  when a matching fixer ships with Roslyn, in the bundled catalog, or inside one of the project's
  own analyzer references (the bundled one wins for an ID both carry).

**What could not be loaded is named.** Roslyn reports an analyzer reference it cannot load — one
built against a newer `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis` than RoselineMCP's, a corrupt file — by
contributing *zero* analyzers, not by failing. The three diagnostics responses carry an
`analyzerLoad` block (`analyzersRan`, `referencesConsulted`, `referencesContributing`, `analyzersLoaded`, and a
`notes[]` entry per reference that contributed nothing: its name, the reason — `load-failure`
with Roslyn's `errorCode` and message, `no C# analyzers`, `unresolved` (the assembly is not on
disk, so it was removed from the loaded solution before Roslyn choked on it), or `exception`). The block is omitted
when every reference contributed, so a present one always says something; see
[`docs/API.md`](docs/API.md#analyzerloadreport).

Set `RoselineMCP:RunAnalyzers` to `false` for compiler-only diagnostics (faster on big
solutions; see [Configuration](#configuration) and the analyzer-execution note in
[`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md)). The block is then present with `analyzersRan: false`, so "off"
stays distinguishable from "all fine".

## Examples

### Analyzing a Solution

```bash
# Using with an MCP client
mcp call analyzeSolution '{
  "pathOrGit": "/Users/dev/MyProject/MyProject.sln",
  "severity": "warning",
  "maxDiagnostics": 50
}'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "solution": "MyProject.sln",
  "projects": 5,
  "diagnosticSummary": {
    "error": 2,
    "warning": 15,
    "info": 28
  },
  "topDiagnostics": [
    {
      "id": "CS0168",
      "severity": "warning",
      "message": "The variable 'ex' is declared but never used",
      "file": "Program.cs",
      "line": 42
    }
  ]
}
```

### Applying Fixes

```bash
mcp call applyFixes '{
  "project": "MyProject.Core.csproj",
  "ids": ["CS0168", "RCS1001"],
  "previewOnly": true
}'
```

Response includes a unified diff patch showing all changes that would be applied.

## Configuration

RoselineMCP reads `appsettings.json` and `appsettings.{Environment}.json` from the directory the
server binary is installed in (`AppContext.BaseDirectory`) — **not** from the process working
directory. Launching the server from inside a target repository never picks up that repository's
own `appsettings.json`, and the settings packaged with the `dotnet tool` install are always found.
Configuration is read once at startup; there is no reload-on-change file watching.

### Environment Variables

Environment variables prefixed with `ROSELINE_` override the JSON files, using `__` as the section
separator. Settings under the `RoselineMCP` section therefore take a double prefix:

```bash
# RoselineMCP:EnableDiagnosticLogging
ROSELINE_RoselineMCP__EnableDiagnosticLogging=true

# RoselineMCP:DefaultTimeout (ms)
ROSELINE_RoselineMCP__DefaultTimeout=300000

# RoselineMCP:RunAnalyzers (compiler-only diagnostics when false)
ROSELINE_RoselineMCP__RunAnalyzers=false

# RoselineMCP:ConfirmDestructiveWrites (no elicitation before writes; unattended hosts)
ROSELINE_RoselineMCP__ConfirmDestructiveWrites=false

# RoselineMCP:ConfirmDestructiveWritesTimeout (ms to wait for that confirmation; 0 = forever)
ROSELINE_RoselineMCP__ConfirmDestructiveWritesTimeout=300000

# Logging:LogLevel:RoselineMCP
ROSELINE_Logging__LogLevel__RoselineMCP=Debug
```

- `DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT`: Set environment (Development, Production)

### appsettings.json

Configure logging and other settings:

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "RoselineMCP": "Debug"
    }
  },
  "RoselineMCP": {
    "DefaultTimeout": 120000,
    "EnableDiagnosticLogging": false,
    "WorkspaceCache": true,
    "RunAnalyzers": true,
    "ConfirmDestructiveWrites": true,
    "ConfirmDestructiveWritesTimeout": 300000
  }
}
```

- `RoselineMCP:DefaultTimeout`: Wall-clock **analysis** budget (ms) applied to each tool call, in addition to the caller's own cancellation. `0` disables it. On the three write tools it does not cover the whole invocation: when a write confirmation is elicited, this clock starts only *after* the human answers, so think-time is charged to `ConfirmDestructiveWritesTimeout` instead. Size it for the analysis, not for the span a caller observes.
- `RoselineMCP:EnableDiagnosticLogging`: Opt-in, local-only tracing of tool invocations — see [Debug Logging](#debug-logging). Disabled by default; enabled in `appsettings.Development.json`.
- `RoselineMCP:WorkspaceCache`: Reuse the loaded MSBuild workspace across navigation/edit tool calls (enabled by default) — see [Performance](#performance). Set to `false` to load a fresh workspace on every call. **This is an isolation/debugging switch, not a memory-saving one** — measured, disabling it costs ~26% more resident memory and ~45× second-call latency; see [Memory Management](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#memory-management).
- `RoselineMCP:RunAnalyzers`: Run Roslyn analyzers (bundled Roslynator + the target project's own analyzer references) in the diagnostics tools (enabled by default) — see [Supported Analyzers](#supported-analyzers). Set to `false` for compiler-only diagnostics.
- `RoselineMCP:ConfirmDestructiveWrites`: Ask the client to confirm (via MCP elicitation) before a write tool actually writes, when the caller passed `previewOnly: false` (enabled by default). Set to `false` for unattended hosts — CI, headless agents, or any client that cannot answer an elicitation — in which case the explicit `previewOnly: false` opt-in is the only guard before a write.
- `RoselineMCP:ConfirmDestructiveWritesTimeout`: How long (ms) to wait for that confirmation before treating the silence as "no" and returning a preview (default `300000`, 5 minutes). It is deliberately **not** `DefaultTimeout` — that is an analysis budget, and a human reading a real diff may legitimately exceed it. A client that accepts the prompt and never answers used to block the tool call forever; set this to `0` or less to restore that unbounded wait.

## Architecture

RoselineMCP uses **stdio transport** — this is an intentional design decision. The server runs as a local process launched by the MCP client (Claude Desktop, AI agents), communicates over stdin/stdout, and exits when the client disconnects. This makes it perfectly suited for distribution as a NuGet global tool (`dotnet tool install -g RoselineMCP`) or Docker image — no port binding, no HTTP server, no infrastructure to manage.

## Performance

- **Workspace Cache** -- The navigation, edit, and diagnostics/fix tools (`ListDiagnostics`,
  `ApplyFixes`, and everything backed by `IProjectLoader`) reuse the loaded `MSBuildWorkspace`
  across calls, cutting hundreds of milliseconds of reload off every call after the first. Cached
  entries are fingerprinted (last-write-time + size of the `.sln`, every `.csproj`, and every
  source file, plus their directories) and re-checked on each call, so any change on disk —
  including RoselineMCP's own edits — triggers a fresh reload. A file/directory whose own last
  write was still fresh when its stamp was captured also gets a content signature (a hash, or a
  directory listing) recorded alongside it, so a same-length write landing in the same
  filesystem-timestamp bucket is still caught by comparing that signature rather than trusted on a
  bare stat match — cheaply, without forcing a reload on every call while the file stays fresh.
  Disable with
  `RoselineMCP:WorkspaceCache = false` — but note that this is an isolation/debugging switch, **not**
  a way to reduce memory: a disposed workspace's memory is not returned to the OS, so disabling the
  cache measures ~26% *worse* on resident memory as well as ~45× slower. The measured profile — and
  why an idle-release was evaluated and rejected — is in
  [Memory Management](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#memory-management)
- **Workspace Isolation (AnalyzeSolution)** -- `AnalyzeSolution` still creates a fresh
  `MSBuildWorkspace` per operation (see [Architecture](#architecture))
- **Sequential Project Analysis** -- Projects within a solution are analyzed one at a time, not
  concurrently, to keep MSBuild workspace state consistent
- **Result Capping** -- `maxDiagnostics`/`max` bound how many diagnostics are returned per call,
  independent of how many were found

## Compile guard

The compile gate behind `EditMember`/`RenameSymbol`/`ApplyFixes` only fires on writes made **through
those tools**. The compile guard puts the same verdict behind every file write in a C# solution —
`Edit`, `Write`, `MultiEdit`, whatever your agent reached for — by running as a `PostToolUse` hook
that asks the already-running server for a verdict over a local socket.

**It reports; it cannot block.** `PostToolUse` fires *after* the tool has written, and the hook
contract carries no blocking decision. What the guard does is surface the introduced compiler errors
to the agent inside the same turn, so the next thing it does is repair them instead of building on
top of them. Preventing the write is not on offer — see
[the issue](https://github.com/Atypical-Consulting/RoselineMCP/issues/168) for why the alternative
that *can* block was rejected.

Turn it on (it is **off** by default), then install the hook:

```bash
# 1. the server opens the local guard endpoint
export ROSELINE_RoselineMCP__Guard=true

# 2. print the settings.json block and paste it into .claude/settings.json
roseline-mcp guard --print-hook
```

What it does on each write:

| Situation | Result |
|---|---|
| The edit introduced compiler errors | the errors, in the agent's turn (exit `2`, stderr) |
| The edit introduced nothing | **silence** — exit `0`, no output, no tokens |
| The branch was already red | **silence** — pre-existing errors are not the agent's doing |
| Not a `.cs` file, or no owning project | **silence** |
| Server not running, or slow to answer | **silence** — a guard that cannot inform must not interrupt |

Compiler diagnostics only, and scoped to the changed project plus its dependents, so it is fast
enough to sit in an inner loop. It adds a local IPC endpoint: read
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#known-risk-the-compile-guard-endpoint) before enabling it on a shared
machine.

## Security

- **Read-Only by Default** -- `AnalyzeSolution`, `ListDiagnostics`, `CreatePatch`, and all six code
  navigation tools (`SearchSymbols`, `GetSymbolInfo`, `FindReferences`, `FindImplementations`,
  `GetCallGraph`, `GetTypeHierarchy`) never write to disk. The three write-capable tools —
  `ApplyFixes`, `EditMember`, and `RenameSymbol` — each default to `previewOnly: true`; writing
  requires the caller to pass `previewOnly: false` explicitly. Behind that opt-in sits a second,
  best-effort guard: the write tools ask the client to confirm via MCP elicitation before writing,
  and a decline downgrades the call to a preview. So does an unanswered prompt — the round-trip is
  bounded by `RoselineMCP:ConfirmDestructiveWritesTimeout` (default 5 minutes), after which the call
  returns a preview rather than writing or hanging. That confirmation is skipped when the client
  cannot elicit, and an operator can disable it outright with
  `RoselineMCP:ConfirmDestructiveWrites=false` — after which `previewOnly: false` is the only guard
  left. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- **Real, Read-Only Git Cloning** -- `pathOrGit` accepts `http(s)://` Git URLs, which are
  shallow-cloned (`git clone --depth 1`) into a temp directory that's deleted after the operation.
  No other URL scheme is treated as a Git remote.
- **MSBuild Is Not a Sandbox** -- loading a `.sln`/`.csproj` via `MSBuildWorkspace` is a
  design-time MSBuild evaluation and can execute build logic embedded in the project (`<Exec>`
  tasks, custom `UsingTask` assemblies, imported `.targets`/`.props`). Analyzing a fully untrusted
  repository or URL carries a real code-execution risk on the host. **See
  [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md)** for the full write-up and operator recommendations before
  pointing RoselineMCP at untrusted input.
- **Analyzer Execution Is Code Execution** -- the diagnostics tools also run the target project's
  own referenced Roslyn analyzers in-process (see
  [Supported Analyzers](#supported-analyzers)); an analyzer from an untrusted repository is
  arbitrary code. `RoselineMCP:RunAnalyzers = false` disables the **diagnostic analyzer** pass
  (bundled Roslynator included). See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).
- **Code-Fix Providers Come From Those Same References** -- `list_diagnostics` and `apply_fixes`
  also load the `CodeFixProvider` types a project's own analyzer references carry. That adds no
  assembly the analyzer pass does not already load (each is obtained through the reference's own
  assembly loader), but it is a decision rather than an accident, and `RunAnalyzers = false` does
  not govern it. Recorded in [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).
- **Source Generators Run Regardless Of That Switch** -- generators ship through the same
  `AnalyzerReferences`, but run as part of building *any* compilation rather than as part of the
  diagnostics pass, so every semantic path executes them -- all navigation tools included. They
  cannot be suppressed without breaking semantic analysis. `RunAnalyzers = false` narrows the
  code-execution surface of an untrusted repository; it does not close it. Isolate instead --
  see [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).
- **No Dedicated Path-Traversal Sandbox** -- paths are resolved with plain existence checks, not
  canonicalized against an allowed root; treat `pathOrGit`/`project`/`branch` as trusted operator
  input.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **MSBuild not found**: Ensure .NET SDK is installed and in PATH
2. **Solution won't load**: Check for missing NuGet packages, run `dotnet restore`
3. **No analyzer (RCS*/SA*) diagnostics found**: Verify `RoselineMCP:RunAnalyzers` isn't set to `false`; for non-bundled rule sets (e.g. StyleCop), verify the analyzer is installed in the target project
4. **Permission denied**: Ensure read access to solution files

### Debug Logging

Enable detailed logging:

```bash
ROSELINE_Logging__LogLevel__RoselineMCP=Debug dotnet run --project RoselineMCP/RoselineMCP.csproj
```

### Tracing Individual Tool Calls

Every tool call gets a per-invocation correlation ID (a GUID). It's cheap to generate so it's
always created, but it's only surfaced when you need it: it's included in every JSON error
response (`correlationId`) and attached to that call's log lines via `ILogger.BeginScope`, so a
user reporting a failure can hand you one ID that ties back to the full server-side log entry —
without needing to grep timestamps.

For deeper, opt-in tracing of each tool invocation (start/stop, duration, success/failure) as a
`System.Diagnostics.Activity` span, set `RoselineMCP:EnableDiagnosticLogging` to `true` (it's
already `true` in `appsettings.Development.json`):

```bash
ROSELINE_RoselineMCP__EnableDiagnosticLogging=true dotnet run --project RoselineMCP/RoselineMCP.csproj
```

This uses the built-in `ActivitySource`/`Activity` APIs rather than the OpenTelemetry SDK, so it
adds no extra dependency. Spans are logged exclusively through the existing `ILogger` pipeline,
which is already routed to stderr — never to stdout (the MCP JSON-RPC channel) — and nothing is
ever sent over the network; when the flag is off (the default), no listener is registered and the
spans cost essentially nothing.
